# Linux-Game-Helper

**Linux-Game-Helper** is a small utility that uses `protonhax` to run Windows executables (*trainers or other tools*) inside Steam’s Proton environment.

This Python application simplifies the process of running external tools (like **game trainers** or **other executables**) with your Proton-enabled Steam games. It automatically detects the running game using `protonhax`, and provides a user-friendly GUI to either:

- Launch a **pre-configured trainer** for the current game, or  
- Select and run a **different executable (*OtherExe*)** on the fly  

All of this happens *without* needing to open a terminal window.

Many Linux users are not comfortable with the terminal, so this tool is designed to make running executables inside Steam’s Proton instance as **simple** and **user-friendly** as possible.

## Features

- ✅ Automatically detects the currently running game via `protonhax ls`
- ✅ Offers a **Trainer / OtherExe** choice when a game is detected
- ✅ For **Trainer**:
  - Looks up a **saved trainer path** for the current GameID
  - Prompts to **select a trainer** if none is configured
  - Saves trainer paths **per game** in a simple config file
- ✅ For **OtherExe**:
  - Lets you select any `.exe` (or other file) and runs it under the same Proton instance
  - **Does not** save this path to the config (*one-off run*)
- ✅ Runs via  
  `nohup protonhax run ... >/dev/null 2>&1 &`  
  (no terminal window)
- ✅ GUI only appears when **user input is required** (no noisy popups in normal use)

## How It Works

1. On start, the script runs:

   ```bash
   protonhax ls
   ```

   and parses the output to find the current Steam **GameID**.

2. If no GameID is found, a GUI message is shown:

   > **Protonhax GameID Not Found Running**

3. If a GameID is found, a dialog appears:

   - **Trainer** → Use the configured trainer for this GameID (or ask you to pick one and save it).  
   - **OtherExe** → Let you pick any executable and run it *without* saving to config.

4. For configured trainers, the tool stores mappings in a config file next to the script, for example:

   ```ini
   [Game Trainer Locations]
   3489700 - = "/path/to/exe"
   ```

5. When launching, it uses:

   ```bash
   nohup protonhax run <GameID> "/path/to/exe" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

   so it runs in the background with **no open terminal**.

## Dependencies

### System Requirements

A Linux distribution with:

- **Python 3** (*most distros include this by default*)
- A working **Steam + Proton** setup
- The **`protonhax`** tool installed and configured

### Required Tools

1. **Python 3**

   Check if Python 3 is installed:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **protonhax**

   Linux-Game-Helper relies on `protonhax` to:

   - Detect which Proton game is currently running (`protonhax ls`)
   - Run the trainer/other executable in that same Proton context (`protonhax run`)

   Install and configure **`protonhax`** according to its documentation.

3. **wxPython** (for the GUI)

   The GUI is built with **wxPython**. You can install it via your distro or `pip`.

   **Ubuntu / Debian:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-wxgtk4.0
   ```

   **Arch / Manjaro:**

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S python-wxpython
   ```

   **Fedora:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install python3-wxpython4
   ```

   **Via pip (any distro):**

   ```bash
   pip install wxPython
   ```

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/Linux-Game-Helper.git
   cd Linux-Game-Helper
   ```

2. **Make sure dependencies are installed:**

   - `python3`
   - `protonhax`
   - `wxPython`

3. **Make the script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x LinuxGH.py
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Make sure your **Proton game is running** (started from Steam).

2. Run **Linux-Game-Helper** from a terminal or a launcher:

   ```bash
   ./trainer.py
   ```

   or:

   ```bash
   python3 trainer.py
   ```

3. The program will:

   - Call `protonhax ls` to detect the active **GameID**.  
   - If no game is detected, show:

     > **Protonhax GameID Not Found Running**

   - If a game is detected, show a dialog:

     - **Trainer**  
       - If a trainer is configured for this GameID and the file exists → it will be launched **immediately**.  
       - If no trainer is configured, you’ll be asked to **browse for the trainer executable**. Once selected, it is **saved in the config** and used automatically next time.

     - **OtherExe**  
       - You’ll be asked to select *any* executable.  
       - It will be launched under the **current Proton instance**.  
       - This path is **not** saved to the config (*one-time run*).

---

## Configuration File

The script stores trainer paths per game in a config file located in the **same directory** as the script, typically called:

```text
trainer_config.ini
```

**Example structure:**

```ini
[Game Trainer Locations]
3489700 - = "/home/youruser/Applications/Trainers/trainer.exe"
```

- The key is **`<GameID> -`**  
- The value is the **quoted absolute path** to the trainer executable.

You generally don’t need to edit this file manually—the GUI will update it when you select trainers—but you *can* tweak it if you know what you’re doing.

---

## Notes & Limitations

- This tool depends on **`protonhax`** being correctly installed and able to **detect your running Proton games**.
- The program only shows a GUI when:
  - No game is detected.
  - A trainer is not configured or the path is invalid.
  - You need to choose between **Trainer** and **OtherExe**.
- All launches are done in the background with:

  ```bash
  nohup protonhax run ... >/dev/null 2>&1 &
  ```

  so you **won’t see a console window**.
